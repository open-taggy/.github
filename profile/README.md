Tagging content in web-based editorial systems, 
*i.e. assigning content to a selection of topics* 
- is mostly still done manually
- therefore tedious and error-prone

especially when it comes to large amounts of data.

Proprietary systems are often expensive and questionable in terms of data protection

- open
- easy-to-start-with
- easy-to-integrate and 
- quite powerful frontend module 

to fit your tagging needs.
