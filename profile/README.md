Tagging content in web-based editorial systems -
*i.e. assigning content to a selection of topics* - 

is mostly still done manually and therefore tedious and error-prone. Especially when it comes to large amounts of data.

Proprietary systems are often expensive and questionable in terms of data protection


## 🎯 taggy is here to give you
an open, easy-to-start-with, easy-to-integrate and quite powerful 
frontend module to fit your tagging needs.

Just define some trigger words or put in your existing glossar and start to tag your content.

## 💡 Examples
### Website User Form
Assign user requests automatically to the right internal tracks
