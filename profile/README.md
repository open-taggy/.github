taggy is a frontend package to automatically tag (or categorize) textual input on your website.
</p>

## 🧩 The problem

Tagging content in web-based editorial systems -
*i.e. assigning content to a selection of topics* - 
is mostly still done manually and therefore tedious and error-prone. Especially when it comes to large amounts of data.
Proprietary systems are often expensive and questionable in terms of data protection.

## 🎯 taggy gives you
- An open, easy-to-start-with, easy-to-integrate and quite powerful frontend module to fit your tagging needs.

- Just define some trigger words or put in your existing [glossar](#the-glossar) and start to tag your content. 

## 💡 Examples
### 1. Website Forms
Assign form input by your users automatically to the right internal tracks:

Let taggy categorize your blogposts:

## 📘 Documentation

### The Glossar
This is a list of trigger words in JSON-fomrat with top- and sub-tags. taggy categorizes the input based on that.
See <a href="https://github.com/open-taggy/taggy/blob/main/data/glossar-abo.json">here</a> for an example.
