# taggy | Open Semantic Tagging

- Tagging content in web-based editorial systems - i.e. assigning content to a selection of topics - is mostly still done manually, therefore tedious and error-prone. 
Especially when it comes to large amounts of data.

- Proprietary systems are often expensive and questionable in terms of data protection. 



### taggy is here to change that by giving you an open, easy-to-start-with and powerful tool to fit your tagging needs.
